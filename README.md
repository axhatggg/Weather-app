# Weather app

#### Hey! this is my first git hub repository, learning how to push my projects in github.

#### hosted it here :- https://axhatweatherapp.netlify.app/

(currently this is not my final commit in this project maybe i'll add a dark mode/light mode switch and display more accurate and good temperature details and most importantly a loading bar when data is getting fetched or a when slow network request.)
